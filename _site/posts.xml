<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="today-is-me-awareness-day.">Today is ME awareness day.</h3>
<p>Soph and I have been together for 12 years. She is a speech therapist and the most extraordinary person I know. She is beautiful, darkly funny, stubborn, fiercely independent, and selfless. She loves cooking, watching the birds, poetry, flowers, dancing, eating, and countless other things. She still love those things, she just now has to fight to just survive every second, minute, and hour, instead of living.</p>
<p>Because Soph has very severe ME and whole body neuropathic pain. She is currently bedbound, only managing to go to the bathroom every 2 weeks on average, and even that she does through pure stubbornness and force of will. Her pain is indescribable, but right now we watch her writhe and hear her wail as there is no respite. It is relentless. It is brutal. It is never ending. She sleeps for only one hour a night, but has nightmares about being stabbed because there is no escape from her pain. She lies in her bed 24 hours a day, in a darkened room, with sunglasses on due to her light sensitivity. She has sound and touch sensitivity. We have not kissed or hugged for several years. She is probably the poorliest person I - and most likely you reading this - will ever know or read about. And we (modern medicine and society as a whole) do not know how to treat people this severe. They get left and forgotten about. And when they’re so severe you do not hear from them, because Soph can barely use her phone due to fatigue and cognitive issues and mainly messages in emojis, only 4 or 5 times a day. It is traumatic and exhausting to try and put into words how ill she is, and I do not do it enough. This is me trying to do it more, maybe little and often will be easiest.</p>

  <title>Submitting files to ENA</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/about">European Nucleotide Archive</a> (ENA) provides a comprehensive record of the world’s nucleotide sequencing information, covering raw sequencing data, sequence assembly information and functional annotation. I always find it so painful to submit to ENA. I do it so rarely (maybe once or twice a year) that by the time I come to do it again, I have forgotten how to do it. The ENA documentation is quite good, but it is not always clear what you need to do. I have written this post to help me remember how to submit files using the Webin-CLI software and hopefully help others who are in a similar position.</p>
<p>So I assume that you have stumbled across this post in a similar position: you have a bunch of sequencing data you want to submit to ENA. Throughout this post, I will reference the <a href="https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">online documentation</a> provided by the ENA, and you will need to signup to the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/#home">interactive</a> Webin submission service and download the Webin command line submission interface (<a href="https://github.com/enasequence/webin-cli">Webin-CLI</a>).</p>
<p>Overall the process for submitting sequencing files can be summarised as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Register a study (interactive online)</li>
<li>Register samples (interactive online and using Excel)</li>
<li>Create sample metadata (using Excel)</li>
<li>Make individual manifest files for each sample (I use R)</li>
<li>Rename files if needed (I use R)</li>
<li>Submit samples (using bash and Webin-CLI)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="submitting-files-to-ena" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="submitting-files-to-ena">Submitting files to ENA</h2>
<p>We will go through each one to summarise the main steps and things I often get wrong.</p>
<section id="register-study-using-the-interactive-interface" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="register-study-using-the-interactive-interface">1. Register study using the interactive interface</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is to register your study. This is easiest to do interactively on the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/">Webin Submissions Portal</a> and the ENA have a help page on this <a href="https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/study/interactive.html">here</a>. The Register Study link is currently found towards the top left of the page.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://padpadpadpad.netlify.app/posts/ena_file_submission/register_study.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>ENA submission portal</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This is the easiest bit of the process and probably the only part that doesn’t take me several attempts. If submitting sequences from a study that is nearing publication, you can enter the study title and the abstract. The release date of the study is when all the sequences will become public. I generally put this for a week after I started the process to allow me to make many mistakes, but post submission you can always bring this date forward. Citations can be added at a later date, so it is possible to submit sequencing before the work is published.</p>
<p>Make a note of the Accession Number for your study as it will be used later (should start with <strong>PRJEB</strong>).</p>
</section>
<section id="register-samples-using-the-interactive-interface" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="register-samples-using-the-interactive-interface">2. Register samples using the interactive interface</h3>
<p>A sample is sequenced biomaterial, and we need to register samples to make sure each sample has metadata associated with it. Samples are associated with checklists, which define the fields used to annotate the samples. The ENA help page for this is quite <a href="https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/samples/interactive.html">good</a>.</p>
<p>When using the interactive submission portal, you need to click through to <strong>Register Samples</strong> and then click <strong>Download spreadsheet to register samples</strong>. There are many different standardised sheets to choose from which should help provide consistent metadata that will allow for better reporting of datasets in the future.</p>
<p>However, as most of the sequencing I upload are from bespoke, controlled experiments in the lab, I have generally only used the <strong>ENA default sample checklist</strong> which is within <strong>Other Checklists</strong> There are some fields that are mandatory for that checklist. What they are, and their definition is displayed after you have clicked on your checklist.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://padpadpadpad.netlify.app/posts/ena_file_submission/fields.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>ENA sample fields for default sample checklist</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If there are extra fields you want to add, then add them, otherwise click <strong>Next</strong> and click <strong>Download Template Spreadsheet</strong>, which will download a .tsv file that contains the minimum required fields for the ENA sample register. When opened in Excel (<strong>the horror</strong>), this will look something like this.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://padpadpadpad.netlify.app/posts/ena_file_submission/empty_samples_checklist.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Empty ENA samples checklist</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>You can then fill out your samples checklist. There is some key advice from the <a href="https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/samples/interactive.html">ENA documentation</a> when filling out this spreadsheet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not remove or modify, the first three lines of the spreadsheet, which specify the checklist in use, field names, and units row.</li>
<li>Enter data in row 4 of the spreadsheet onwards. Use row 3 (#units) to specify units where required by the checklist.</li>
<li>You can add custom fields by inserting new column headers</li>
<li>Do not edit the existing column names</li>
</ul>
<p>From doing this a few times, I have my own advice for future me that past me learned the hard way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every sample is always associated with a taxon, which is inputted into the <strong>tax_id</strong> column and then the <strong>scientific_name</strong> column. I use the NCBI <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy">taxonomy browser</a> to find the correct taxon. For example, sediment metagenome has the taxonomy ID of 749907.</li>
<li>When inputting numbers into Excel, when you double click them to go autofill, they often follow a numeric rule (x+1) or something. Copy and paste the same number into the cell below, and then double click them both to autofill and this does not happen.</li>
<li>Each sample needs to have its each individual row. The <strong>sample_alias</strong> column needs to be a unique identifier to identify that sample. It is unique to <strong>ALL</strong> future submissions too so make sure you label them in relation to the study <strong>AND</strong> the sample. For example for a recent project on Myxobacteria I started all of them with <strong>myxo_16s_s1</strong> or <strong>myxo_rpoB_1</strong> etc. All the other columns are relative self explanatory. You can also add metadata columns. An example completed file - saved as a<code>.txt\</code> might look something like this.</li>
<li>I generally have the same name for the <strong>sample_title</strong> as I do for the <strong>sample_alias</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>sample_description</strong> column, I generally put what sequencing was done.</li>
<li>For most studies, I also add extra columns that are unique to the study and represent treatments and extra data that is interesting and needed to best understand the files. For example, I added columns about what predefined habitat the samples came from and what biome the sample was classified as. I also added metadata collected by a collaborator on where the sample was taken and the latitude and longitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>My most recent sample checklist looked like this:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://padpadpadpad.netlify.app/posts/ena_file_submission/complete_samples_checklist.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Complete ENA samples checklist</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Once completed, this file can be uploaded to the ENA interactive web portal by clicking <strong>Register Samples</strong> -&gt; <strong>Upload filled spreadsheet to register samples</strong> and then <strong>Submit Completed Spreadsheet</strong> after you have chosen your file. The portal will tell you if you are successful which means you can move on to the next stage.</p>
</section>
<section id="create-sample-metadata" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-sample-metadata">3. Create sample metadata</h3>
<p>After doing steps 1 and 2, you should receive emails containing the Accession Numbers of your experiment and of your samples. These need to be included in a manifest file that is required for the submission of each sample to ENA. Details on the manifest file can be found <a href="https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/reads/webin-cli.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The information needed for each sample may change based on what files are being uploaded. For paired end fastq reads, they are generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>STUDY: Study Accession Number, from Step 1.</li>
<li>SAMPLE: Sample Accession Number, from Step 2.</li>
<li>NAME: Experiment name, which I generally use the same as the <strong>sample_alias</strong>.</li>
<li>PLATFORM: Sequencing platform</li>
<li>INSTRUMENT: Sequencing instrument</li>
<li>INSERT_SIZE: Size of the sequence is the length of the sequence between the adapter sequences.</li>
<li>LIBRARY_SOURCE: What type of information was sequenced? DNA, RNA, etc.</li>
<li>LIBRARY_SELECTION: Library selection. What selection was done on the DNA? PCR, random, etc.</li>
<li>LIBRARY_STRATEGY: Library strategy. What type of sequencing stratedy was done? WGS, RNA-Seq, etc.</li>
<li>FASTQ: File name of forward fastq file</li>
<li>FASTQ: File name of reverse fastq file</li>
</ul>
<p>I generally create another Excel file, with these values as column names, where I document all the samples from a study. I call this <strong>sample_metadata.csv</strong>, and my most recent one looks like this.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://padpadpadpad.netlify.app/posts/ena_file_submission/sample_metadata.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Example sample metadata</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I leave the fastq columns blank because I am going to rename the files before uploading to be the same as the <strong>sample_alias</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="create-manifest-files-for-each-sample" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-manifest-files-for-each-sample">4. Create manifest files for each sample</h3>
<p>Each sample needs its own manifest file, so I use R to create manifest files from the <strong>sample_metadata.csv</strong> file. We want to make a manifest file for each row of the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>To reiterate, I try to use the <strong>sample_alias</strong> as a unique ID for each manifest file and fastq file linked to the that sample. So I will name each manifest file as the <strong>sample_alias</strong>.txt, and then rename the fastq files to be the same as the <strong>sample_alias</strong>_R1/R2.fastq.gz.</p>
<p>Example code to do this could be:</p>

<p>This should result in you having a unique manifest file for each of your samples that you registered.</p>
<p>An example of the top row from my most recent submission is a file created called <strong>myxo_16s_s1.txt</strong>. Its contents are:</p>
<pre><code>STUDY PRJEB73761
SAMPLE ERS18415308
NAME myxo_16s_s1
PLATFORM ILLUMINA
INSTRUMENT Illumina MiSeq
INSERT_SIZE 300
LIBRARY_SOURCE GENOMIC
LIBRARY_SELECTION PCR
LIBRARY_STRATEGY AMPLICON
FASTQ myxo_16s_s1_R1.fastq.gz
FASTQ myxo_16s_s1_R2.fastq.gz</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="submit-samples" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="submit-samples">5. Submit samples</h3>
<p>Once you have your manifest files, you can submit them to ENA. However, it is likely that before you do this you may need to rename your files to match the names you specified in the FASTQ values of each manifest file. This is because the manifest file will be looking for files with those names in the directory where you specify the fastq files are.</p>
<p>So I have started creating a new folder called <strong>ena_upload</strong> where I copy and rename the samples to for ena submission. These can then be deleted after submission is successful.</p>
<p>I do file renaming in R, and this is likely to be bespoke for each project and how you have named your sample aliases. In case there are mistakes down the line in your file renaming or submission - or you find that some files do not have the metadata you thought they had - it might be useful to save out a csv with all the original names and the new names.</p>
<p>An example of what this might look like is:</p>

<p>This should result in the sequencing files being renamed to match the names specified in the manifest files. We should then be able to upload them to ENA. I use the ENA webin-cli tool to do this. You can find the documentation for this tool <a href="https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/reads/webin-cli.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>We can now run Webin-cli to submit our samples. We will start by validating our submission to check no terrible errors have occurred. This bit is now done in the <strong>Terminal</strong> using <strong>bash</strong>.</p>

  <title>Recreate Ed Hawkins’ climate spiral in R</title>
  <dc:creator>Daniel Padfield</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Climate change is happening, and changes in average temperatures are happening quickly. The 5 hottest years on record have occurred in the last six years for which we have data. One of the best ways to demonstrate climate warming is through data visualisations, and one of the best examples of this are Ed Hawkins’ <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/planet/climate-resources/climate-stripes">climate stripes</a>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://padpadpadpad.netlify.app/posts/climate_spiral/climate-stripes.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Ed Hawkins’ Climate Stripes</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This visualisation is made up of vertical stripes, each representing the average temperature for a single year, relative to the average temperature over the whole period (from 1880 to the most recent year for which we have data). Blue colours indicate cooler-than-average years, while red colours indicate years that were hotter than average. As you can see, the increasing redness on the right-hand side of the graphic shows the rapid heating over recent years.</p>
<p>I love the simplicity of this graphic, and it has proved a very effective tool for improving people’s awareness of climate warming (see the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23climatestripes&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">#climatestripes</a> for amazing examples of its use across the world).</p>
<p>I also loved the climate spiral animation created by Ed and re-created by <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/300/video-climate-spiral/">NASA</a> to help people understand the concept of global warming and the change in global temperatures over time. The spiral presents a visual representation of temperature changes over the past century or more, by showing a line that spirals outwards from the center of the graph as time progresses.</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWoCXLuTIkI" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>In the centre of the spiral is the average temperature of a baseline period, typically the 20th century average. As the line moves outwards, the temperature increases, with each full rotation of the spiral representing one year of data. The thickness of the line represents the magnitude of the temperature change in each year, with thicker lines indicating larger temperature increases.</p>
<p>Having played with <strong>ggplot2</strong> and <strong>gganimate</strong> a bit, I was interested if I could recreate this animation in R (unfortunately without the amazing axis flip at the end)!</p>

<p><em>At the time of writing this blog post, using <strong>gganimate</strong> for <strong>geom_path()</strong> and <strong>transition_reveal()</strong> is <a href="https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate/issues/473">unfortunately bugged</a> in version 1.0.8, meaning that some frames would be missing. As such we will install a previous version (1.0.7).</em></p>
<p>This post will walkthrough how to recreate Ed Hawkins’ famous climate spiral in R. We will mainly use the <strong>tidyverse</strong> packages and <strong>gganimate</strong> to do this. Firstly we will load in these required packages.</p>

<p>This dataset has month across the top with some other columns I do not necessarily understand, and the values in the month columns are the temperature anomaly. Right now all the columns have been read in character format, so we can do some data wrangling to get the data in the correct format for <strong>ggplot2</strong>. This includes going from wide to long format, stacking all the months on top of each other in a single column.</p>
<p>These commands could all be linked together using successive pipe commands, but I kept them separate to better document what each line is doing.</p>

<p>This is looking quite good, but still quite far from the polished version on NASA’s YouTube. One of the problems we have is that <strong>geom_path()</strong> will not cross over the 0-360 line when using <strong>coord_polar()</strong>. This would ruin the whole visualisation and prevent us having a smooth transition from year to year. This was a problem I was not clever enough to solve, but luckily <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55132352/geom-path-refuses-to-cross-over-the-0-360-line-in-coord-polar">StackOverflow</a> had the answer. We need to convert the polar coordinates to cartesian to allow the animation to go from December to January of the next year.</p>

<p>We now have the position of each anomaly for each month in x/y space. This should allow the animation to smoothly move between December of one year to January of the next.</p>
<p>Our original plot also does not have very nice labelling to tell us anything about the extent of the anomaly (1ºC above or below average etc.)</p>
<p>However, we can add these ourselves by using some functions from <strong>ggforce</strong> to create circles on our plot and labelling them. We also create a dataframe to place the months at a nicer place on the plot.</p>
<p>We can control the font size of <strong>geom_text()</strong> in terms of font size used in the rest of the plot using the <strong>pts()</strong> function that I copied from <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/">Andrew Heiss</a>.</p>

<p>This looks great and more like what NASA created. We can easily animate this using <strong>gganimate::transition_reveal()</strong> and adding the column for time that we created earlier.</p>
<p>We can add a frame for every single row of the dataframe using <code>nframes = nrow(d)</code>. We will also add a point to make it more obvious where we are at any given time.</p>

<p>This looks amazing! There are probably ways I could improve the animation but this suits my motivations right now. For example, I have not linked the size of the line to the extent of the change, but this should be relatively easy to implement.</p>
<p>I generally love this type of visualisation, and the spiral could be used on other data, such as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels or Arctic sea ice extent, to show how these variables have changed through time. By presenting data in this way, the Climate Spiral helps people to understand the steady, consistent increase in global temperatures over time, and the urgency of addressing climate change.</p>
<p>Let me know if you found this helpful and if you any questions!</p>

  <title>Rolling regression to estimate microbial growth rate</title>
  <dc:creator>Daniel Padfield</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Microbial ecologists often measure the growth rates of their favourite microbes, commonly using an OD (optical density) reader, with growth being related to the increasing OD of the sample through time. There are loads of ways to analyse these curves. Most of these, like <a href="https://github.com/sprouffske/growthcurver"><strong>growthcurver</strong></a> and the methods I used in my recent <a href="https://github.com/padpadpadpad/Padfield_2019_ISME_bact_phage_temperature">ISME</a> paper (<a href="https://github.com/padpadpadpad/nls.multstart"><strong>nls.multstart</strong></a> and functions from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlsMicrobio/nlsMicrobio.pdf"><strong>nlsMicrobio</strong></a>), fit models to logistic growth. Both methods can easily be scaled up to fit multiple curves at the same time.</p>
<p>However, sometimes these methods do not do a good job. The most common example when this happens is if the wee critters do not reach stationary phase. Without stationary phase, most of the models will struggle to calculate carrying capacity, which also means the estimated exponential growth rate is poor. Similar things can occur if the bacteria form biofilms. This can result in increasingly noisy measurements at higher OD readings, again making the estimation of carrying capacity and growth rates more difficult.</p>
<p>As an alternative, we can bin off trying to model the entire growth curve, and instead implement a rolling regression, where we fit a linear regression on a shifting window of points. On natural-log transformed OD, the slope of the regression between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?logOD"> and time is equivalent to the exponential growth rate.</p>
</section>
<section id="get-started" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="get-started">Get started</h3>
<p>We will load (and install) all the packages needed to run the example here. We will use the example data from <strong>growthcurver</strong> as example OD readings from a 96-well plate. Time is in hours, and I have created stacked all the wells into a single column for OD. Finally I created a column for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?logOD">, which is needed for the rolling regression, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?log_%7B10%7DOD"> which is needed for fitting the modified gompertz growth model from <strong>nlsMicrobio</strong>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fit-modified-gompertz-model-for-bacterial-growth">Fit modified gompertz model for bacterial growth</h3>
<p>We will first demonstrate rolling regression against the modified gompertz model for growth. I like the inclusion of the lag parameter in this model, especially for OD readers where the initial inoculate can often be so low that the OD reader cannot measure it. It means that exponential growth is only calculated at OD readings that we are confident represent changes in biomass of the bacteria.</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll filter the data for just the first well, A1. Then we will fit the modified gompertz model and plot the results.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-rolling-regression">Using rolling regression</h3>
<p>Rolling regression allows us to calculate exponential growth rate even when we do not have the whole curve. First, we need to create our own rolling regression function. This method is mainly taken from G. Grothendieck’s <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49762128/rolling-regression-by-group-in-the-tidyverse">StackOverflow answer</a>. In the function, we specify our output from a standard <strong>lm</strong> object. So if you know how to access the output of <strong>lm()</strong>, you can add any extra details you want.</p>
<p>One of the big decisions in rolling regression is deciding how many points you are going to calculate the growth rate over. In this example, measurements are taken every 0.167 hours, about every ten minutes. I want a shifting window to span a minimum of 1.5 hours, so I calculate <code>num_points</code> to define the number of points the rolling regression will act on.</p>
<p>We then run the rolling regression, using <strong>zoo::rollapplyr()</strong> and <strong>dplyr::do()</strong>. Finally, in order to illustrate what the rolling regression is doing, I created a predictions dataframe for every single linear model that is fitted.</p>

<p>We can plot the rolling regression through time. I have extracted the exponential growth rate as the maximum slope of any of the regressions. Reassuringly the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> we get is very similar to that of using the gompertz model. I have also plotted the time at which the maximum slope occurred. It looks pretty close to mid-log to me.</p>

<p>These growth rates can then be used for downstream analyses, and the method can easily be used over multiple plates and for many different types of data. Finally, you could also filter the regressions by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E%7B2%7D"> values, making sure you only kept good fitting regressions. Or do a sensitivity analysis of different sized window sizes to make sure your chosen window is suitable.</p>
<p>How do you get your data off of the OD reader? I have written scripts to collate hundreds of plate readings into a single dataframe in R. Let me know if you would like me to do a blog post on that process! Thanks for reading.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-started-with-rstrava">Getting started with rStrava</h2>
<p><strong>rStrava</strong> is an R package that allows you to access data from Strava using the Strava API. Some of the functions of <strong>rStrava</strong> scrape data from the public Strava website but to access your own data you will need a Strava profile and an authentication token. Details on obtaining your unique token can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava"><strong>rStrava</strong></a> GitHub In addition to this key, we use <code>rgbif::elevation()</code> to calculate the elevation of each route. This requires a Google API key which can be created here.</p>
<p>Got a Strava authentication token? Got a Google API key? We are ready to create some animations! To create our animations, we use gganimate that requires ImageMagick to be installed.</p>
</section>
<section id="loading-packages-and-defining-tokens" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="loading-packages-and-defining-tokens">Loading packages and defining tokens</h2>
<p>First load the packages that are used in the script and our Strava and Google authentication tokens. The <code>app_scope</code> argument in <code>strava_oauth()</code> has to be one of “read” , “read_all”, “profile:read_all”, “profile:write”, “activity:read”, “activity:read_all” or “activity:write”. To access your activities, <code>activity:read_all</code> has to be included.</p>

<p>We can then download our personal activity data using the <code>rStrava::get_activity_list()</code>. This function needs your strava token and your strava athlete id. For example, my strava id is 2140248.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="compile-your-data-into-tidy-dataframe">Compile your data into “tidy” dataframe</h2>
<p><strong>rStrava</strong> has a function that compiles the information stored in the output of <code>get_activity_list()</code> to a “tidy” dataframe, with one row for each activity. <code>compile_activities()</code> finds all the columns across all activities and returns <code>NA</code> when a column is not present in a given activity. This means that if HR was not measured across all your strava activities, the function will still work!</p>

<p>There are so many columns here, so I remove some columns I am not interested in for this post and do some data transformations to get the date in a correct format. I also do not want to run the example on all my rides, instead I filter them for just 2020.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="get-latitude-and-longitude-for-each-activity">Get latitude and longitude for each activity</h2>
<p>Each activity has a bunch of data associated with it. For mapping, I am interested in the <code>map.summary_polyline</code>, which is a Google polyline which allows the encoding of multiple latitude and longitude points as a single string. We can get the latitude and longitude for each of the activities by using <code>get_latlon()</code> which decodes the polylines and using dplyr and purrr to iterate over every activity in the dataframe. I add my Google API key as a column so that <code>map()</code> can easily find it.</p>

<p>Having got the latitude and longitude for every ride, we can now get the elevation of each point and then calculate the gradient between points. To do this I use <code>elevation()</code> in the R package <strong>rgbif</strong>. To use this, you need to get a GeoNames username by registering for an account at <a href="http://www.geonames.org/login">http://www.geonames.org/login</a>.</p>

<p>However, Google polylines do not give a consistent number of latitude and longitude points. This means it might be hard to get a smooth elevation profile for the ride and also for smooth transitions in a gif. To create a set number of points from the current polyline, we can use geospatial packages such as <strong>sp</strong> and <strong>raster</strong> to interpolate a desired number of points from the current ones. Here I create 250 points.</p>

<p>And there we have it. A relatively simple way to animate your strava activities in R. I personally find that saving the output as .mp4 rather than .gif gives smaller and higher quality files when uploading them to Instagram, but these options are easy to change. Take back your own data and get plotting!</p>
<p>There are loads of other functions and uses for the <strong>rStrava</strong> package. I hope to blog more about them soon.</p>

  <title>Bootstrap nls models in R</title>
  <dc:creator>Daniel Padfield</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>This post was updated to reflect the improvement of using car to bootstrap nonlinear regressions.</em></p>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>For my first academic publication, a reviewer asked for the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E%7B2%7D"> values of the thermal performance curves I fitted using non-linear regression. I bowed to the request as is often the case with reviewer comments, but would now resist as the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E%7B2%7D"> is not necessarily an effective goodness of fit measure for non-linear regression (see this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14530770/calculating-r2-for-a-nonlinear-model">SO answer</a>). It does raise the question of how to determine how well a biologically meaningful model fits the data it is fitted to. I generally just plot every curve to its data, but it tells me nothing of the uncertainty around the curve.</p>
<p>Step forward the bootstrap! (Non-parametric) bootstrapping is a robust way of computing parameter and model prediction confidence intervals. Bootstrapping involves simulating “new” datasets produced from either the original data (case resampling) or from the original model (residual resampling).</p>
<p>The same model is then fitted separately on each individual bootstrapped dataset. Doing this over and over allows us to visualise uncertainty of predictions and produce confidence intervals of estimated parameters. When previously implementing this, I used methods similar to previous blog posts by <a href="https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/19698_a4c472606e3c43e4b94720506e49bb7b.html">Andrew MacDonald</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/269">Hadley Wickham</a>, as well as a <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/vignettes/bootstrapping.html">broom vignette</a>.</p>
<p>However, I have since applied a more efficient method using the package <strong>car</strong>, which contains the function <code>Boot()</code> that provides a wrapper for the widely used function <code>boot::boot()</code> that is tailored to bootstrapping regression models.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-resampling-resampling-the-original-data-with-replacement">Case resampling: Resampling the original data with replacement</h2>
<p>Bootstrapping using case resampling involves simulating “new” datasets produced from the existing data by sampling with replacement.</p>
<section id="case-resampling-when-it-works" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-resampling-when-it-works">Case resampling: When it works</h4>
<p>We will demonstrate an example of when this case resampling approach works using data from a recent paper by Padfield <em>et al.</em> (2020), that measures the thermal performance of the bacteria, <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em>, in the presence and absence of its phage, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi%202">. In this study, each single growth rate estimate is a technical replicate. As such, all the data points within each phage treatment can be used to estimate the same curve. The data is in the R package <a href="https://padpadpadpad.github.io/rTPC/index.html"><strong>rTPC</strong></a> and we can visualise one of the curves using <strong>ggplot2</strong>.</p>

<p><code>nls_multstart()</code> is designed to fit models across a wide possible parameter space, but as it samples multiple start parameters for each model, using it with bootstrapping becomes computationally expensive. Instead, we refit the model using <strong>minpack.lm::nlsLM()</strong>, using the coefficients of <code>nls_multstart()</code> as the start values. The <strong>Boot()</strong> function then refits the model 999 times and stores the model coefficients.</p>

<p>This method works well here, because there are many points beyond the peak of the curve and multiple independent points at each temperature.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-resampling-when-it-struggles">Case resampling: When it struggles</h4>
<p>This method becomes more problematic when there is a small sample size and the coverage of temperature values beyond the optimum temperature is small. This means that many of the bootstrapped datasets will not have any points beyond the optimum, which is problematic for mathematical models that expect a unimodal shape. The effect of this can be seen by case resampling a curve from the <code>chlorella_tpc</code> dataset also in <strong>rTPC</strong>. Here we again fit the model using <code>nls_multstart()</code>, refit the model using <code>nlsLM()</code>, then bootstrap the model using <code>Boot()</code>.</p>

<p>As can be seen, bootstrapping-with-replacement with only a single point at each temperature can lead to a large variety of fits. In the second panel, we can see the variation of the curve fits, clustering around 4 possible paths for the decrease in rate beyond the optimum temperature. This occurs because in many instances there are no points sampled at the very high temperatures, leading to this clustering in curve fits.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="residual-resampling">Residual resampling</h2>
<p>Case resampling is the most common way of thinking about bootstrapping. However, bootstrapping ordinary least squares regression models is often done using bootstrapping residuals. This method - where the values of the predictors in a study remain fixed during resampling - is especially useful in a designed experiment where the values of the predictors are set by the experimenter.</p>
<p>Re-sampling residuals, at its heart, follows a simple set of steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fit the model and for each data point, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">, retain the fitted values <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7By_%7Bi%7D%7D"> and the residuals, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7Be_%7Bi%7D%7D%20=%20y_%7Bi%7D%20-%20%5Chat%7By_%7Bi%7D%7D"></li>
<li>For each data pair, (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_i">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i">), where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_i"> is the measured temperature value, we add a randomly re-sampled residual, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7Be%7D"> to the fitted value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7By_i%7D">. This becomes the new <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i"> value, such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i%20=%20%5Chat%7By_i%7D%20+%20%5Chat%7Be%7D">. The new response variable is created based on the random re-allocation of the variation around the original model fit</li>
<li>The model is refit using the newly created <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i"> response variable</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 a number of times</li>
</ol>
<p>This method makes the assumption that the original model fit is a good representation of the data, and that the error terms in the model are normally distributed and independent. If the model is incorrectly specified – for example, if there is unmodelled non-linearity, non-constant error variance, or outliers – these characteristics will not carry over into the re-sampled data sets.</p>
<p><strong>car::Boot()</strong> has an argument that allows us to easily implement residual resampling instead of case resampling, by setting <code>method = 'residual'</code>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calculating-confidence-intervals-of-estimated-parameters">Calculating confidence intervals of estimated parameters</h2>
<p>Bootstrapping can be used to estimate confidence intervals of the parameters explicitly modelled in the regression. We can compare these approaches to profiled confidence intervals (using <strong>confint-MASS</strong>) and asymptotic confidence intervals (using <strong>nlstools::confint2()</strong>). For the bootstrapped parameter distributions, <strong>confint.boot()</strong> supports the calculation of BCa, basic, normal, and percentile confidence intervals. We use BCa here, and we will calculate all CIs on the two models done previously in this vignette. First with the bacteria TPC.</p>

<p>Each panel is a different explicitly modelled parameter. The dashed lines represent the 95% intervals for the profiling method. In general, the different bootstrap methods are similar to the profiled intervals, but not all parameters are the same. For example, <code>r_tref</code> and <code>e</code> give wider (and asymmetric) confidence intervals using the case resampling method. The residual method gives estimates that are more similar to those calculated from profiling.</p>

<p>Crucially, bootstrapping allows the calculation of confidence intervals for parameters derived from the model that were not present in the initial fitting process. For example, the optimum temperature of a thermal performance curve, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_%7Bopt%7D"> is calculated as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_%7Bopt%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7BE_%7Bh%7DT_%7Bh%7D%7D%7BE_%7Bh%7D%20+%20k%20T_%7Bh%7D%20ln(%5Cfrac%7BE_%7Bh%7D%7D%7BE%7D%20-%201)%7D"> We can calculate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_%7Bopt%7D"> by writing a custom function that we feed into <code>Boot()</code>.

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>With my research, I often use non-linear least squares regression to fit a model with biologically meaningful parameters to data. Specifically, I measure the thermal performance of phytoplankon growth, respiration and photosynthesis over a wide range of assay temperatures to see how the organisms are adapted to the temperatures they live at.</p>
<p>These thermal performance curves generally follow a unimodal shape and parameters for which are widely used in climate change research to predict whether organisms will be able to cope with increasing temperatures.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://padpadpadpad.netlify.app/posts/nlsmultstart/TPC.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Example Thermal Performance Curve</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>These curves can be modelled with a variety of equations, such as the Sharpe-Schoolfield equation, which I have log-transformed here:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?log(rate)%20=%20lnc%20+%20E(%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BT_%7Bc%7D%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BkT%7D)%20-%20ln(1%20+%20e%5E%7BE_h(%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BkT_h%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BkT%7D)%7D)"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?lnc"> is a normalisation constant at a common temperature, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_%7Bc%7D">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E"> is an activation energy that describes the rate of increase before the optimum temperature, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_%7Bopt%7D">. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> is Boltzmann’s constant, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E_%7Bh%7D"> is the deactivation energy that controls the decline in rate past the optimum temperature and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_%7Bh%7D"> is the temperature where, after the optimu, the rate is half of the maximal rate.</p>
<p>Say I want to fit the same equation to 10, 50, or 100s of these curves. I could loop through a call to <strong>nls()</strong>, <strong>nlsLM()</strong>, or use <strong>nlsList()</strong> from <strong>nlme</strong>. However, non-linear least squares regression in R is sensitive to the start parameters, meaning that different start parameters can give different “best estimated parameters”. This becomes more likely when fitting more curves with only a single set of start parameters, where the variation in estimated parameter values is likely to be much larger. For example, some curves could have much higher rates (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?lnc">), higher optimum temperatures (i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_%7Bh%7D">) or have different values of temperature-dependence (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E">).</p>
<p>To combat this, I wrote an R package which allows for multiple start parameters for non-linear regression. I wrapped this method in an R package called <a href="https://github.com/padpadpadpad/nlsLoop"><strong>nlsLoop</strong></a> and submitted it to The Journal of Open Source Software. Everything was good with the world and I went to a Christmas party.</p>
<p>The next day, I had an epiphany surrounding the redundancies and needless complexities of my R package, withdrew my submission and rewrote the entire package in a weekend to give rise to a single function package, <strong>nls.multstart::nls_multstart()</strong>. Essentially since I first wrote <strong>nlsLoop</strong> ~3 years ago I have realised that <strong>broom</strong> and <strong>purrr</strong> can do what I wrote clunkier functions to achieve. In contrast, <a href="https://github.com/padpadpadpad/nls.multstart"><strong>nls.multstart</strong></a> works perfectly with the tools of the <strong>tidyverse</strong> to fit multiple models.</p>

<p>There are 60 curves in this dataset, 30 each of photosynthesis and respiration. The treatments are growth temperature (20, 23, 27, 30, 33 ºC) and adaptive process (acclimation or adaptation) that reflects the number of generations cultures were grown at each temperature.</p>
<p>We can see how <strong>nls_multstart()</strong> works by subsetting the data for a single curve.</p>

<p><strong>nls_multstart()</strong> allows boundaries for each parameter to be set. A uniform distribution between these values is created and start values for each iteration of the fitting process are then picked randomly. The function returns the best available model by picking the model with the lowest AIC score. Additional info on the function can be found <a href="https://github.com/padpadpadpad/nls.multstart">here</a> or by typing <code>?nls_multstart</code> into the R console.</p>
<p>This fit can then be “tidied” in various ways using the R package <strong>broom</strong>. Each different function in <strong>broom</strong> returns a different set of information. <strong>tidy()</strong> returns the estimated parameters, <strong>augment()</strong> returns the predictions and <strong>glance()</strong> returns information about the model such as the AIC score and whether the model has reached convergence. Confidence intervals of non-linear regression can also be estimated using <strong>nlstools::confint2()</strong></p>
<p>The amazing thing about these tools is the ease at which they can then be used on multiple curves at once, an approach Hadley Wickham has previously <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/02/02/tidyr-0-4-0/">written about</a>. The approach nests the data based on grouping variables using <strong>nest()</strong>, then creates a list column of the best fit for each curve using <strong>map()</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are confused, then you are not alone. This took me a long time to understand and I imagine there are still better ways for me to do it! However, to check it has worked, we can look at a single fit to check it looks ok. We can also look at <code>fits</code> to see that there is now a <code>fit</code> list column containing each of the non-linear fits for each combination of our grouping variables.</p>

<p>When plotting non-linear fits, I prefer to have a smooth curve, even when there are not many points underlying the fit. This can be achieved by including <code>newdata</code> in the <strong>augment()</strong> function and creating a higher resolution set of predictor values.</p>
<p>However, when predicting for many different fits, it is not certain that each curve has the same range of predictor variables. We can get around this by setting the limits of each prediction by the <strong>min()</strong> and <strong>max()</strong> of the predictor variables.</p>

<p>This method of modelling can be used for different data, different non-linear models (and linear models for that matter) and combined with the <strong>tidyverse</strong> can make very useful visualisations.</p>
<p>The next stage of these curve fits is to try and better understand the uncertainty of these curve fits and their predictions. One approach to achieve this could be bootstrapping new datasets from the existing data. I hope to demonstrate how this could be done soon in another post.</p>
