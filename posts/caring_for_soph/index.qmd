# Introduction

You may know me. You may not. I am Daniel Padfield, a microbial ecologist and carer. I live in Cornwall and my partner of 11 years is called Sophia Galpin. She lives in Cheltenham with her family and has very severe ME. She has been getting steadily worse for around 10 years, and is now bedbound in constant neuropathic pain. I visit every three weeks for 3 to 4 days.

The pain and suffering she gets through is very difficult to describe, but I have decided to try and document each visit in some, small way. This is my account, of how it feels to watch her, of how I see her suffering. This is my account because she cannot tell the world about what she is going through. Right now she cannot speak. Cannot text in full sentences. Cannot write.

*A warning that this set of posts are going to be very sad.*

I feel like I live my life like Gromit on the train, constantly laying down the tracks in front of myself to keep going. Every day I lay down a new track, prioritising what to do that day - or at best that week or that month - uncertain and unable to plan much beyond that. Living precariously, day by day. 

In some ways it often feels like I live two separate lives. In one life, I work in Cornwall at the University of Exeter, researching how bacteria respond to environmental change and in the other I care for Soph in Cheltenham. I try my best to juggle both and switch off from one when I am doing the other, but the stress and trauma of watching Soph suffer, and occasionally work stress, inevitably blend into some constant low-level - sometimes more severe - depression that makes managing both work and life rather challenging. The contrast between my last day at Soph's to my first back at work is always stark: holding a cup for Soph to eat soup to making presentation slides, coding or editing manuscripts

Logistically it has become increasingly challenging. I visit Soph every third week, and beforehand I self-isolate for 5 days to ensure I do not have covid or any other illness that I could pass on to her. In practice, this means I only have 8 days in person at work in every 15 (work days). I have 4 days at home isolating, and 3 at Soph's or travelling to Soph's. Part of my research involves lab work, but in reality this has been  incredibly challenging to plan and do. I rarely go to conferences or visit other research groups, and I miss seminars and visiting researchers I would like to chat to. As a research fellow I currently do not have many teaching responsibilities, but at some point that will change. Planning in-person activities with people alongside making sure I am covid (and other illness) free for visiting Soph is a constant anxiety for me. Caring for someone automatically makes you a hypochondriac. I second guess when my throat feels the tiniest bit different. The consequences of bringing a virus to Soph’s house are frightening. Then if I do get covid then all other plans would have to be shifted to accommodate a rearranged Soph visit. It makes my brain hurt thinking about it.

Emotionally and mentally, maintaining a full time job in academia while caring for Soph is hard, especially so recently as Soph has gotten worse. Although she may have stabilised over the last two visits, we have stabilised at a place much worse than before. Less time together. Less interaction. More suffering. And with that my depression has flared. I have been on antidepressants for several years, and I do counselling every third week (with Action for ME). I have become addicted to the routine and endorphins that exercise gives me. But it just isn't enough at times. Some days, no matter how much I will myself, I cannot get out of bed. Scrolling to numb my brain. Napping to avoid the world. Unable to shift the haze of anxiety or the big black blob of dread that lives in the pit of my stomach. My inability to make my brain productive and do what I know I should be doing just makes me feel further behind with work, which fuels work stress. It is a never ending cycle.

And yet I am coping.  I still manage to help care for Soph and maintain a career in academia. And even though most of the time it does not feel like it, somehow my career seems to still be going well. I am lucky and privileged for the opportunities I have, for the flexibility that my job currently allows me to look after Soph. And I have very understanding colleagues and a great support network that looks out for me.  I am also getting better at letting some less important stressors go, to make time for myself and acknowledge that I need that afternoon of self care to make sure I can keep at least some of the plates turning. 

Whether undressing Soph while she screams in pain one day, or analysing growth curves, attending meetings, and editing manuscripts. Both days start the same, with getting out of bed. 

There are so many feelings of guilt, sadness, and grief - as well as fleeting smiles, happiness, and warmth - but this is a good introduction to how I “manage”.

## 13/07/2024 The shifting baseline of severe ME and grieving what we've lost.

The shifting baseline is a concept used in fisheries management which reflects how in the present day we underestimate how big a fish population was before human exploitation. Because we have overfished many species of fish for a long period of time, we lose perception of what "untouched" actually is, and through the generations we forget just how many fish there were in the first place. This makes it hard to know what we should aim for in terms of management, and what numbers of fish we could get back to. This shifting baseline is exactly the same dilemma we face as Soph's condition has worsened.

Eleven years ago (according to my Google Photos) Soph and I were on holiday in Italy. But if you saw her today you would be completely shocked.She would quite possibly be the poorliest person you have ever seen. She screams in pain. She can't speak. Her hand constantly shakes. She has not gotten out of bed for \>3 months, not gone downstairs for several years, and not eaten solid food for longer than that. You would expect her to be in hospital under specialist care. And yet we as a family have normalised so much. We normalise what Soph fights through everyday, and what we witness, so that we can cope and continue caring for her. It’s normal for us that she only eats soup, and that we hold the cup to her mouth. That she loses eyesight in one eye several times a day. That she cannot tolerate light or sound. That she cannot look to her right or left without triggering a vertigo attack. This is our baseline. Because Sophs's health has worsened quite slowly, we sometimes forget just how crazy everything has become. It also makes it hard to imagine what it even is that we would like to get back to, but this is an existential question that lives in the back of my brain.

Soph and I have gradually lost the ways that we connect as she has deteriorated. Each time we lose something, we find another way to connect and keep some sort of intimacy, before eventually that too, is taken from us. There are too many heartbreaks to cover, so I will keep to two that remain raw for me. For three years or so Soph watched birds in the garden during breakfast. She would come alive when fledglings came to the feeders and be in awe of the colours of the greenfinch, robins, and - on the rare occasion - the great spotted woodpecker. Our breakfast time was precious, a moment we could share together every day, and her mum and dad could share in it when I was not there. It’s been 1.5 years since Soph last went to the window to watch the birds. Today I saw 4 fledged goldfinches on the birdfeeder. It brings mixed emotions as I know how much Soph would have loved to see them.

To maintain our connection, Soph and I would make eye contact with each other twice a day for 30 seconds or so. We would just be present in that moment, and time would stand still. Her eyes are so expressive. But in the last two months that has gone too. Survival eats up almost all of her energy, and there is just so little left to be used for social interactions right now. My heart is broken, even more so because of the heartbreak and anguish I know Soph is also going through (on top of all the suffering). So now I grieve yet another loss alongside the general depression that comes with watching Soph suffer. I have managed to somehow cope with all the other losses, overcome the grief. However, I did not take notes so I feel like I am starting from scratch. Who knows when and how I will overcome it this time.

## 23/06/2024 Six voice messages, a photo of a swan, and 15 emojis.

Early in 2024 I went to a Level 1 Makaton training course organised by the University. I had a very unique reason for going: to better communicate with Soph my 35 year old partner. The ability to communicate is something we take for granted, but it is just another thing that has become increasingly difficult for Soph. In person she now communicates with very strained words, some makaton, and some of her own signs (her birthday sign is especially resourceful), but it is when she holds in screams or holds back severe pain that makes it plain to us all how much she is suffering. And when her hand shakes uncontrollably and her head and arms writhe we know a crash is coming. If she has only just started eating, she somehow manages to continue because she knows she has to.

She only sees people for maybe an hour a day due to her fatigue, so outside of that she communicates via WhatsApp with shortened words and emojis. These are mostly to discuss soup choices and times for us to go up to do lunch/dinner etc. These are also ingenious as she describes the ingredients for a soup in a mix of emojis and broken words. For example the message:

:broccoli:, Cour toast:corn:, :pinching_hand: :potato:, hard GC, thy

Translates to:

Broccoli, courgette, toasted corn, a small amount of potato, hard goats cheese and thyme.

Her mum and I translate these - mostly successfully - and when we discuss what Soph tells us we interestingly retell everything in full sentences. Maybe to humanise the conversations, to make them more like what Soph sounds like as we know she still is inside.

I had no idea how much I rely on these tiny messages, until they become less regular or stopped altogether. You can spend an hour looking at your phone because you know she is going to message, and you worry that something catastrophic has happened. Last Wednesday when I was in Cornwall I did not hear from Soph after 5pm until the next morning. That had never happened before in several years of her being bedbound. She had a big crash and was just incapable of messaging. And knowing how desperate she is to message, how lonely she is lay alone in bed just makes it worse. I panicked, spiralled and took the Thursday off work.

I send her maybe 5 or 6 voice messages a day telling her about the mundanities of my life in Cornwall. I try to take photos of baby animals, beaches, and sunsets to send to her. I receive back heart emojis and the broken words. I miss her voice. I miss her laugh. I miss her touch. I also feel pressure to maintain those voice messages, as it is the only voice she hears outside of her mum's and dad's in a day. I am prone to sending messages while pottering around, banging a door, or boiling the kettle, and that creates background noise that makes the message harder for Soph to listen to. I know I shouldn't feel guilty, and yet I am trying to do better.

There are so many complexities about communication I cannot cover in a short post. How Soph's mum discusses treatment options with her now I have no idea. How Karen and I have to discuss so many things about visiting and Soph because she does not have the energy to. How she must feel forgotten as she is not able to communicate with people she loves. How she feels so alone. The mutual frustration of me not being able to understand a sign and the obvious toll it takes on Soph's energy to have to repeat it several times. Soph is extremely resourceful and incredible for being able to communicate despite everything. And I try so hard to try to understand because every message, sign, word is precious, a privilege to try to decipher. She is an incredible woman, fighting to survive and keep any semblance of a personal connection wherever she can.

## 02/06/2024 The worst it has ever been.

Why do I always think it cannot get any worse? [Wychwood Music Festival](https://wychwoodfestival.com/) is on at the Racecourse two fields away from Soph's house. The sound feels louder than previous years and now reverberates through her room. This makes her condition worse. The earplugs she uses do very little to help. She holds her hands to her ears in pain. She cannot move to another room. There is no escape. It is just something else that is relentless. Torture. Suffering. It is going to last three days. Each day compounds onto the next. She starts each new day relatively more poorly than the last, and all her energy needs to go into eating and doing the bare minimum. Since all of her energy is used up for surviving, there isn’t any left for actually living. No energy can be used for talking, engaging, being. I cannot fathom how lonely Soph must be. It is beyond heartbreaking. And through all this she thinks of other people. She asks me to leave because she does not want our time together - already limited in duration and scope - to be like this. She does not want me to see her like this. And yet maybe this is the new normal - at least for a bit. [Post exertional malaise](https://meassociation.org.uk/medical-matters/items/symptoms-post-exertional-malaise-pem/) is unpredictable and we do not have a great track record of seeing Soph's condition improve after big crashes. So maybe I will have to see her like this to be able to see her at all, at least for a bit. But we hope. As I write this on Sunday morning I don't know whether I will see her today. Maybe I will stay and just cook soup for her, food for her family, and be around for emotional support for her parents. Maybe I will see her. I cannot ask Soph because she has no energy to answer. I am supposed to have a small holiday on Tuesday. Not really sure how.

Soph's mum rings people at the local council and gets a number for the local environment monitors who reassure her that they are well within their sound limits. But that isn’t the point. A loud music festival might be a slight annoyance for most people but it is brutal for Soph. No one understands. How can anyone understand how impossible life is for Soph and her family? They do amazing things everyday to survive and be the best they can be but severe ME is just incompatible with life sometimes. However much we try we cannot control everything.

Here is a video of baby swans I saw to try and give me some level of happiness. Soph will love this video, but I do not know when she will have the energy to see it.
