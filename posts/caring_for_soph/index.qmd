# Introduction

You may know me. You may not. I am Daniel Padfield, a microbial ecologist and carer. I live in Cornwall and my partner of 11 years is called Sophia Galpin. She lives in Cheltenham with her family and has very severe ME. She has been getting steadily worse for around 10 years, and is now bedbound in constant neuropathic pain. I visit every three weeks for 3 to 4 days.

The pain and suffering she gets through is very difficult to describe, but I have decided to try and document each visit in some, small way. This is my account, of how it feels to watch her, of how I see her suffering. This is my account because she cannot tell the world about what she is going through. Right now she cannot speak. Cannot text in full sentences. Cannot write.

*A warning that this set of posts are going to be very sad.*

## 02/06/2024 The worst it has ever been.

Why do I always think it cannot get any worse? [Wychwood Music Festival](https://wychwoodfestival.com/) is on at the Racecourse two fields away from Soph's house. The sound feels louder than previous years and now reverberates through her room. This makes her condition worse. The earplugs she uses do very little to help. She holds her hands to her ears in pain. She cannot move to another room. There is no escape. It is just something else that is relentless. Torture. Suffering. It is going to last three days. Each day compounds onto the next. She starts each new day relatively more poorly than the last, and all her energy needs to go into eating and doing the bare minimum. Since all of her energy is used up for surviving, there isn’t any left for actually living. No energy can be used for talking, engaging, being. I cannot fathom how lonely Soph must be. It is beyond heartbreaking. And through all this she thinks of other people. She asks me to leave because she does not want our time together - already limited in duration and scope - to be like this. She does not want me to see her like this. And yet maybe this is the new normal - at least for a bit. [Post exertional malaise](https://meassociation.org.uk/medical-matters/items/symptoms-post-exertional-malaise-pem/) is unpredictable and we do not have a great track record of seeing Soph's condition improve after big crashes. So maybe I will have to see her like this to be able to see her at all, at least for a bit. But we hope. As I write this on Sunday morning I don't know whether I will see her today. Maybe I will stay and just cook soup for her, food for her family, and be around for emotional support for her parents. Maybe I will see her. I cannot ask Soph because she has no energy to answer. I am supposed to have a small holiday on Tuesday. Not really sure how.

Soph's mum rings people at the local council and gets a number for the local environment monitors who reassure her that they are well within their sound limits. But that isn’t the point. A loud music festival might be a slight annoyance for most people but it is brutal for Soph. No one understands. How can anyone understand how impossible life is for Soph and her family? They do amazing things everyday to survive and be the best they can be but severe ME is just incompatible with life sometimes. However much we try we cannot control everything.

Here is a video of baby swans I saw to try and give me some level of happiness. Soph will love this video, but I do not know when she will have the energy to see it.
