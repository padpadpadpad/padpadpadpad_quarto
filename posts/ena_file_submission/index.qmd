## Introduction

The [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/about) (ENA) provides a comprehensive record of the world’s nucleotide sequencing information, covering raw sequencing data, sequence assembly information and functional annotation. I always find it so painful to submit to ENA. I do it so rarely (maybe once or twice a year) that by the time I come to do it again, I have forgotten how to do it. The ENA documentation is quite good, but it is not always clear what you need to do. I have written this post to help me remember how to submit files using the Webin-CLI software and hopefully help others who are in a similar position.

So I assume that you have stumbled across this post in a similar position: you have a bunch of sequencing data you want to submit to ENA. Throughout this post, I will reference the [online documentation](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provided by the ENA, and you will need to signup to the [interactive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/#home) Webin submission service and download the Webin command line submission interface ([Webin-CLI](https://github.com/enasequence/webin-cli)).

Overall the process for submitting sequencing files can be summarised as:

-   Register a study (interactive online)
-   Register samples (interactive online and using Excel)
-   Create sample metadata (using Excel)
-   Make individual manifest files for each sample (I use R)
-   Rename files if needed (I use R)
-   Submit samples (using bash and Webin-CLI)

## Submitting files to ENA

We will go through each one to summarise the main steps and things I often get wrong.

### 1. Register study using the interactive interface

The first thing to do is to register your study. This is easiest to do interactively on the [Webin Submissions Portal](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/) and the ENA have a help page on this [here](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/study/interactive.html). The Register Study link is currently found towards the top left of the page.

![ENA submission portal](register_study.png)

This is the easiest bit of the process and probably the only part that doesn't take me several attempts. If submitting sequences from a study that is nearing publication, you can enter the study title and the abstract. The release date of the study is when all the sequences will become public. I generally put this for a week after I started the process to allow me to make many mistakes, but post submission you can always bring this date forward. Citations can be added at a later date, so it is possible to submit sequencing before the work is published.

Make a note of the Accession Number for your study as it will be used later (should start with **PRJEB**).

### 2. Register samples using the interactive interface

A sample is sequenced biomaterial, and we need to register samples to make sure each sample has metadata associated with it. Samples are associated with checklists, which define the fields used to annotate the samples. The ENA help page for this is quite [good](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/samples/interactive.html).

When using the interactive submission portal, you need to click through to **Register Samples** and then click **Download spreadsheet to register samples**. There are many different standardised sheets to choose from which should help provide consistent metadata that will allow for better reporting of datasets in the future.

However, as most of the sequencing I upload are from bespoke, controlled experiments in the lab, I have generally only used the **ENA default sample checklist** which is within **Other Checklists** There are some fields that are mandatory for that checklist. What they are, and their definition is displayed after you have clicked on your checklist.

![ENA sample fields for default sample checklist](fields.png)

If there are extra fields you want to add, then add them, otherwise click **Next** and click **Download Template Spreadsheet**, which will download a .tsv file that contains the minimum required fields for the ENA sample register. When opened in Excel (**the horror**), this will look something like this.

![Empty ENA samples checklist](empty_samples_checklist.png) 

You can then fill out your samples checklist. There is some key advice from the [ENA documentation](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/samples/interactive.html) when filling out this spreadsheet:

-   Do not remove or modify, the first three lines of the spreadsheet, which specify the checklist in use, field names, and units row.
-   Enter data in row 4 of the spreadsheet onwards. Use row 3 (#units) to specify units where required by the checklist.
-   You can add custom fields by inserting new column headers
-   Do not edit the existing column names

From doing this a few times, I have my own advice for future me that past me learned the hard way:

-   Every sample is always associated with a taxon, which is inputted into the **tax_id** column and then the **scientific_name** column. I use the NCBI [taxonomy browser](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) to find the correct taxon. For example, sediment metagenome has the taxonomy ID of 749907.
-   When inputting numbers into Excel, when you double click them to go autofill, they often follow a numeric rule (x+1) or something. Copy and paste the same number into the cell below, and then double click them both to autofill and this does not happen.
-   Each sample needs to have its each individual row. The **sample_alias** column needs to be a unique identifier to identify that sample. It is unique to **ALL** future submissions too so make sure you label them in relation to the study **AND** the sample. For example for a recent project on Myxobacteria I started all of them with **myxo_16s_s1** or **myxo_rpoB_1** etc. All the other columns are relative self explanatory. You can also add metadata columns. An example completed file - saved as a`.txt\` might look something like this.
-   I generally have the same name for the **sample_title** as I do for the **sample_alias**.
-   In the **sample_description** column, I generally put what sequencing was done.
-   For most studies, I also add extra columns that are unique to the study and represent treatments and extra data that is interesting and needed to best understand the files. For example, I added columns about what predefined habitat the samples came from and what biome the sample was classified as. I also added metadata collected by a collaborator on where the sample was taken and the latitude and longitude.

My most recent sample checklist looked like this:

![Complete ENA samples checklist](complete_samples_checklist.png)

Once completed, this file can be uploaded to the ENA interactive web portal by clicking **Register Samples** -\> **Upload filled spreadsheet to register samples** and then **Submit Completed Spreadsheet** after you have chosen your file. The portal will tell you if you are successful which means you can move on to the next stage.

### 3. Create sample metadata

After doing steps 1 and 2, you should receive emails containing the Accession Numbers of your experiment and of your samples. These need to be included in a manifest file that is required for the submission of each sample to ENA. Details on the manifest file can be found [here](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/reads/webin-cli.html).

The information needed for each sample may change based on what files are being uploaded. For paired end fastq reads, they are generally:

-   STUDY: Study Accession Number, from Step 1.
-   SAMPLE: Sample Accession Number, from Step 2.
-   NAME: Experiment name, which I generally use the same as the **sample_alias**.
-   PLATFORM: Sequencing platform
-   INSTRUMENT: Sequencing instrument
-   INSERT_SIZE: Size of the sequence is the length of the sequence between the adapter sequences.
-   LIBRARY_SOURCE: What type of information was sequenced? DNA, RNA, etc.
-   LIBRARY_SELECTION: Library selection. What selection was done on the DNA? PCR, random, etc.
-   LIBRARY_STRATEGY: Library strategy. What type of sequencing stratedy was done? WGS, RNA-Seq, etc.
-   FASTQ: File name of forward fastq file
-   FASTQ: File name of reverse fastq file

I generally create another Excel file, with these values as column names, where I document all the samples from a study. I call this **sample_metadata.csv**, and my most recent one looks like this.

![Example sample metadata](sample_metadata.png)

I leave the fastq columns blank because I am going to rename the files before uploading to be the same as the **sample_alias**.

### 4. Create manifest files for each sample

Each sample needs its own manifest file, so I use R to create manifest files from the **sample_metadata.csv** file. We want to make a manifest file for each row of the spreadsheet.

To reiterate, I try to use the **sample_alias** as a unique ID for each manifest file and fastq file linked to the that sample. So I will name each manifest file as the **sample_alias**.txt, and then rename the fastq files to be the same as the **sample_alias**_R1/R2.fastq.gz.

Example code to do this could be:

```{r manifest_file_creation}
#| eval: false

# create single manifest file for each sample from a sample metadata file

# load in tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# read in sample metadata column
files <- read.csv('ena_submission/sample_metadata.csv') %>%
  # make numeric columns character so that pivot longer works
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), as.character))

# create single manifest file for each row
# run a for loop
for(i in 1:nrow(files)){
  
  # grab the first row
  temp <- files[i,]
  
  # go from wide to long format
  temp <- pivot_longer(temp, cols = everything())    
  
  # grab the file name from the NAME row (third element)
  file_name <- temp$value[3]
  
  # rename the fastq columns FASTQ
  temp$name[10:11] <- 'FASTQ'
  temp <- temp[1:11,]
  
  # name the fastq files R1 and R2 and the file name
  temp$value[10] <- paste(file_name, '_R1.fastq.gz', sep = '')
  temp$value[11] <- paste(file_name, '_R2.fastq.gz', sep = '')
  
  # save it out
  # need to create a folder for your manifest files
  write.table(temp, paste('manifest_files/', file_name, '.txt', sep = ''), row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
}
```

This should result in you having a unique manifest file for each of your samples that you registered.

An example of the top row from my most recent submission is a file created called **myxo_16s_s1.txt**. Its contents are:

```
STUDY PRJEB73761
SAMPLE ERS18415308
NAME myxo_16s_s1
PLATFORM ILLUMINA
INSTRUMENT Illumina MiSeq
INSERT_SIZE 300
LIBRARY_SOURCE GENOMIC
LIBRARY_SELECTION PCR
LIBRARY_STRATEGY AMPLICON
FASTQ myxo_16s_s1_R1.fastq.gz
FASTQ myxo_16s_s1_R2.fastq.gz
```

### 5. Submit samples

Once you have your manifest files, you can submit them to ENA. However, it is likely that before you do this you may need to rename your files to match the names you specified in the FASTQ values of each manifest file. This is because the manifest file will be looking for files with those names in the directory where you specify the fastq files are.

So I have started creating a new folder called **ena_upload** where I copy and rename the samples to for ena submission. These can then be deleted after submission is successful.

I do file renaming in R, and this is likely to be bespoke for each project and how you have named your sample aliases. An example of what this might look like is:

```{r file_renaming}
#| eval: false
# rename files for ena upload

# list manifest files names
manifest_files <- list.files('manifest_files', full.names = TRUE)

# list the sequencing files to rename
files <- list.files('where_the_raw_files_live', full.names = TRUE, pattern = 'fastq|fq', recursive = TRUE)

# write for loop ro rename files
for(i in 1:length(manifest_files)){
  
  # grab the first row
  temp <- d[i,]
  
  # grab the ith manifest fuke
  temp <- manifest_files[i]
  
  # remove file extension
  temp <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(temp)
  
  # in this example, the sample identifier is the s1 part, so I will grab that
  # this bit needs to allow you to find the sequencing files - given the current naming - that relate to that manifest file
  temp_num <- str_split(temp, '_')[[1]][3]
  
  # find the sequencing files that link to that manifest file
  files_temp <- files[str_detect(basename(files), paste(temp_num, '_', sep = ''))]
  
  # rename files for ena upload
  # for R1 file

  file.copy(files_temp[str_detect(basename(files_temp), 'R1')], paste('~/ena_upload/', temp, '_R1.fastq.gz', sep = ''))
  # for R2 file
  file.copy(files_temp[str_detect(basename(files_temp), 'R2')], paste('~/ena_upload/', temp, '_R2.fastq.gz', sep = ''))
}
```

This should result in the sequencing files being renamed to match the names specified in the manifest files. We should then be able to upload them to ENA. I use the ENA webin-cli tool to do this. You can find the documentation for this tool [here](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/reads/webin-cli.html).

We can now run Webin-cli to submit our samples. We will start by validating our submission to check no terrible errors have occurred.

```{bash}
#| eval: false

# submitting files to ENA

# check webin-CLI is working
# download latest version from https://github.com/enasequence/webin-cli/releases
wget https://github.com/enasequence/webin-cli/releases/download/7.0.1/webin-cli-7.0.1.jar

# check it exists
ls

# check it is working
java -jar webin-cli-7.0.1.jar -version
# seems to be working

# open a screen
screen -ls # check what screen exist
screen -S ena # start a new screen called ena
# screen -r ena # reopen the screen
#screen -X -S ena quit # you want to kill the screen

# validate each file submission

# path to raw renamed sequencing files
fastq_files=~/ena_upload

# path to manifest files
manifest_files=~/manifest_files

# create a manifest output folder
mkdir -p $manifest_files/output
manifest_output=$manifest_files/output

# run a test
file=$manifest_files/myxo_16s_s1.txt

# run a for loop to submit sequencing files
for file in $manifest_files/*.txt

    do
        # cat the file
        echo $file

        # grab the file name without the extension
        stub=$(basename ${file%.txt})

        man_file=$file
        
        # make a folder for the output of the validation
        mkdir -p $manifest_output/$stub

        # run webin-cli - run validation to check
        java -jar webin-cli-7.0.1.jar -validate -context reads -manifest $man_file -inputDir $fastq_files -outputDir $manifest_output/$stub -username your_username -password your_password
        
  done


```

After this has ran, you can check the output of all the validation files. If there are no errors, you can then submit the files to ENA. This can be done quite simply in R.

```{r validate}
#| eval: false

# check validation reports

# list validation folders
validation_folders <- list.files('~/manifest_files/output', full.names = TRUE)

# setup empty dataframe to populate
d_check <- data.frame(sample = basename(validation_folders),
                      check = NA, 
                      fullname = validation_folders)

# run a for loop to grab the output of the validation report for each sample
for(i in 1:nrow(d_check)){
  # read file in
  temp <- readLines(file.path(d_check$fullname[i], 'webin-cli.report'))
  
  # input it into the correct place in the dataframe
  d_check$check[i] <- temp[length(temp)]
  
}

# drop the full name column
d_check <- select(d_check, -fullname)

d_check
```

My most recent one of these looks like this:

![Checking validation of manifest files](check_validation.png)

We can then run the submission for realsies!

```{bash submit}
#| eval: false

# run a for loop to submit sequencing files
for file in $manifest_files/*.txt
    do
        # cat the file
        echo $file

        # grab the file name without the extension
        stub=$(basename ${file%.txt})

        man_file=$file

        # run webin-cli
        java -jar webin-cli-7.0.1.jar -submit -context reads -manifest $man_file -inputDir $fastq_files -outputDir $manifest_output/$stub -username your_username -password your_password
  done
```

With any luck, these files should then be viewable the Samples Report section of the ENA Web Portal.
