I have broad interests that span climate change, evolution, and community ecology. My research has concentrated on how environmental change alters the interplay of ecological and evolutionary dynamics in microbial communities. I do this by combining theory and simulations with experimental evolution. In January 2023 I started a NERC Independent Research Fellowship at the University of Exeter to explore the links between climate warming and antibiotic resistance in microbial communities. In 2024 I won the Medical Research Foundation Emerging Leaders Prize to do similar work.\n\nOne of my favourite parts of research is exploring new and exciting datasets. I have been using R for >10 years - authoring the R packages **nls.multstart** and **rTPC** - and specialise in the wrangling, manipulation, and visualisation of large datasets and statistical analysis.\n\nI am also a carer for my partner Sophia Galpin. She has full-body neuropathic pain, severe ME/CFS and has been bed-bound for around >5 years. She lives with her parents in Cheltenham and I visit for long weekends every three to four weeks. You can read more about the challenges we face [here](https://padpadpadpad.netlify.app/posts/caring_for_soph/).\n\nIf you are interested in collaborating or have any questions or comments I would love to hear from you.\n\n:::\n\n## Current Group Members\n\n![](images/zoltan_profile.png){width=5cm fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n**Zoltan Erdos** (Postdoctoral researcher 2025 - present). Zoltan is a microbiologist interested in how microbial communities adapt, interact, and evolve in changing environments. Within DanPadLab, Zoltan is investigating the effects of climate change on the selection and spread of antibiotic resistance.\n\nHis research combines experimental evolution, molecular biology, and evolutionary theory to understand the dynamics of cooperation, competition, and coevolution among microbes. He is particularly fascinated by how evolutionary processes shape microbial interactions and community resilience, with applications that span ecosystem function, health, and biotechnology. His recent work includes [characterising stable microbial consortia](https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.001489) for use in experimental evolution, [exploring the evolution of virulence in entomopathogenic fungi](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1011775), and [developing fungal biocontrol agents to combat insect pests](https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ps.6571).\n\nBy integrating fundamental evolutionary principles with applied microbiology, he aims to uncover insights that inform both evolutionary theory and practical solutions in sustainable agriculture and microbial biotechnology.\n\n## Previous Group Members\n\n- Jake Daniels (MSci student, 2024-2025)\n\n:::",
