I am a microbial ecologist working at the University of Exeter in Penryn, Cornwall. I have broad interests that span climate change, evolution, and community ecology. My research has concentrated on how environmental change alters the interplay of ecological and evolutionary dynamics in microbial communities. I do this by combining theory and simulations with experimental evolution. In January 2023 I started a NERC Independent Research Fellowship at the University of Exeter to explore the links between climate warming and antibiotic resistance in microbial communities. In 2024 I won the Medical Research Foundation Emerging Leaders Prize to do similar work.

One of my favourite parts of research is exploring new and exciting datasets. I have been using R for >10 years - authoring the R packages **nls.multstart** and **rTPC** - and specialise in the wrangling, manipulation, and visualisation of large datasets and statistical analysis.

I am also a carer for my partner Sophia Galpin. She has full-body neuropathic pain, severe ME/CFS and has been bed-bound for around >5 years. She lives with her parents in Cheltenham and I visit for long weekends every three to four weeks. You can read more about the challenges we face [here](https://padpadpadpad.netlify.app/posts/caring_for_soph/).

If you are interested in collaborating or have any questions or comments I would love to hear from you.
