I am a microbial ecologist working at the University of Exeter in Penryn, Cornwall. I have broad interests that span climate change, evolution, and community ecology. My research has concentrated on how environmental change alters the interplay of ecological and evolutionary dynamics in microbial communities. I do this by combining theory and simulations with experimental evolution. In January 2023 I started a NERC Independent Research Fellowship at the University of Exeter to explore the links between climate warming and antibiotic resistance in microbial communities.

I am an avid R programmer - authoring the R packages **nls.multstart** and **rTPC** - and specialise in the wrangling and manipulation of large datasets and statistical analysis. I also have experience in bioinformatics from 16S sequencing to _de novo_ genome assembly, the latter using bash scripting.

I am also a carer for my partner. She has full-body neuropathic pain, severe ME/CFS and has been bed-bound for around 4 years. She lives with her parents in Cheltenham and I visit for long weekends every three to four weeks.

If you are interested in collaborating or have any questions or comments I would love to hear from you.
