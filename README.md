# Outline

This is the repository for my personal (lab's) website: The DanPadLab.

The website is written using Quarto and deployed on Netlify. I did not do this alone and mainly took inspiration from a bunch of different amazing people who put their experiences online:

- I used the [GitHub](https://github.com/ddimmery/quarto-website) of Drew Dimmery's [website](https://ddimmery.com/)
- I used the [GitHub](https://github.com/beatrizmilz/blog-en) of Beatriz Milz's [website](https://beamilz.com/) and her amazing [post](https://beamilz.com/posts/2022-06-05-creating-a-blog-with-quarto/en/) about creating a Quarto blog.
- I used the [Github](https://github.com/jthomasmock/themockup-blog) of Thomas Mock's [website](https://themockup.blog/) and checked out his great [presentation slides](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/get-started-quarto/materials/06-websites.html#/websites).
- I used the [GitHub](https://github.com/jmgirard/affcomlab) of Jeffrey Girard's lab [website](https://affcom.ku.edu/), especially for creating a publications page, as documented in this [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/1324)
